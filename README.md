# Team555Tools

This repository is a collection of all of the utilities and helper classes and frameworks used by FRC Team 555, *Montclair Robotics*. This collection was started in 2022, and thus does not contain all utility classes ever used by the team.

The project used to develop these utilities is included, and is called *sourceproj*. Only enter this folder if you are curious about the testing used for these classes and algorithms.

For those who want to use these utilities (which I highly suggest, as they are free for all usage under an MIT Lisence), archives containing groupings of utilities and descriptions of their contents can be found in the *archives* folder. In order to use these source files in your code, simply unzip the provided archives and copy them into your java project's root directory. For most FRC use cases, this will be your `src/main/java` folder.

All classes will be located in the `org.team555` package.

The tools used to generate a consistent layout for the archives found in the *archives* folder can be found in the *archiver* folder.
